Owing to worldwide accessibility and the ease of use, it has not only become the most popular application download destination but also a hotbed for competing services to attract and gain customers. This project aims to employ machine learning & visual analytics concepts to gain insights into how applications become successful and achieve high user ratings.

The dataset chosen for this project was from __. It contains over 1M application data capturing various details like app name, description, genre, reviews, etc. The aim of the  project was the first to find an accurate machine learning model which could fairly accurately predict user ratings on any app when similar data is available.
